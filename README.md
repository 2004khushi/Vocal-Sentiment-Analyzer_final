🎤 Vocal Sentiment Analyzer
Decode emotions from voice using the power of deep learning!

🌟 Overview
The Vocal Sentiment Analyzer is a cutting-edge project that leverages Deep Learning to unlock the emotional essence hidden in human vocal expressions. By combining the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this tool can recognize and classify emotions like:

😄 Happiness   😢 Sadness   😡 Anger
😨 Fear   😒 Disgust   😲 Surprise   😐 Neutrality

This project showcases the fascinating intersection of AI and affective computing, providing a robust framework for real-time emotion recognition from audio input.

🎯 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Extracts meaningful patterns using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to capture the essence of vocal characteristics.
Deep Learning Models: Trains on a diverse dataset to identify complex emotional patterns in audio signals.
Real-Time Analysis: Instantly recognizes emotions from live or recorded audio input.
Applications:
🛠️ Customer Service Enhancements
🧠 Mental Health Monitoring
💬 Sentiment Analysis for Social Media
🤖 Human-Computer Interaction
